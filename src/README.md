## Model code

This is the repository for both the experimental files as well as the different models used in https://psyarxiv.com/f52ud/ . The experiment is started using the Java ACT-R environment. The different models can each be run by importing them and running them in the driving simulation.
Please open an issue or contact moritz.held@uol.de in case there are any issues.
